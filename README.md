# Workouter
Workouter is a simple workout logger application I made to test a new [Backbone.js] (http://backbonejs.org/) architecture and learn more about BDD with [Chai] (http://chaijs.com/), [Sinon] (http://sinonjs.org/), and [Mocha] (http://mochajs.org/). I also got to use [BackboneFire] (https://github.com/firebase/backbonefire).

### Instructions
+ Clone repository
+ Run ``npm install && bower install`` to download frontend dependencies
+ Run ``grunt serve`` to serve development environment
+ Run ``grunt build`` to create production build on ``dist/`` directory
