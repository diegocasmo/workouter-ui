# Workouter
Workouter is a simple workout logger application I made to test a new [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) architecture design.

### Instructions
+ Clone repository
+ Run ``npm install && bower install`` to download frontend dependencies
+ Run ``grunt serve`` to serve development environment
+ Run ``grunt build`` to create production build on ``dist/`` directory
